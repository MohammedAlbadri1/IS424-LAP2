     <h4>About HTML:</h4>
    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links,
         and more. HTML uses a system of tags to mark up content, allowing web browsers to render the page visually. It is a foundational technology for building websites,
          often used in combination with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.</p>

    <h4>About CSS:</h4>
    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages.
         It allows web developers to apply styles to HTML elements, such as fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning,
          creating visually appealing and consistent designs. CSS separates content from design, making it easier to maintain and update the look of a website without altering the HTML structure.
           By using CSS, developers can enhance user experience through responsive design, ensuring that web pages look good on various devices and screen sizes.</p>
